## Project Description

### Backend

The backend is configured using various AWS cloud services:

- **AppSync**: Used for building scalable and secure GraphQL APIs.
- **IAM**: Identity and Access Management for secure authentication and authorization.
- **S3**: Used for storing images and PDF files of the database items.
- **SES (Simple Email Service)**: Assists Lambda functions in sending emails to users regarding their book orders.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing data efficiently.
- **Cognito**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Node.js**: Empowers the backend with JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service used to execute backend functions, such as creating orders and handling email notifications.
- **Amplify and GraphQL**: Facilitate communication between the backend and frontend.


### Frontend

The frontend is implemented using React JS, accompanied by additional tech tools for styling. While the main focus is on cloud services and infrastructure, the frontend complements the overall user experience.
